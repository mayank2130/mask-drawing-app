# React + Vite
I've used the library react-canvas-draw for brush functionality, Axios to communicate with the backend, and aws-S3Sdk to upload images to the S3 bucket and hit the CloudFront URL.

I haven't connected the production backend to the react so <h2>the live link probably won't work</h2> and by probably I mean won't work. :)
